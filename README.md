### IF.05.22 Theoretical Informatics -- Winter 2017
# Assignment 1: Coding Assignment

## Objective
This week's assignment is to get you familiar with Java, repeat recursion and easy algorithmic stuff.

## Materials
- NetBeans IDE.

## Required Tasks
1. Write a Java program that calculates the gcd by calculating the the product of the common prime implicants
2. Write a Java program that calculates the gcd by using the Euclidean algorithm using the mod operator as presented in class

## Evaluation
When you make a pull request your cheat sheet will be graded. Most common reasons to mark down a solution would be
- One or more of the *Required Tasks* section are not satisfied
- Submitted code is visually sloppy and hard to read
